BACKGROUND

- I am seeking a role that allows me to enhance my technical knowledge and continuously learn while also making use of over five years of existing Linux operations experience that I have.
- While my personal projects primarily depend upon PHP and MySQL, I do not necessarily consider myself a developer. I prefer working on the command-line and systems administration. I feel that I am excellent at troubleshooting, debugging, and working through production issues.
- I prefer a casual environment and a short commute, within Philadelphia. Most importantly, I truly value a fun and positive company culture.
