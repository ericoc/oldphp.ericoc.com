			<ul>
				<li>Started: September 9 (Saturday), 2017</li>
				<li>Language: PHP</li>
				<li>I created this PHP library to simplify retrieval of stock quote data using <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quote%20where%20symbol%20in%20("AAPL"%2C"GOOG"%2C"MSFT")&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys#h=select+*+from+yahoo.finance.quote+where+symbol+in+(%22AAPL%22%2C%22GOOG%22%2C%22MSFT%22)" target="_blank">Yahoo's Finance API</a>.</li>
				<li>The PHP class does its best to minimize HTTPS requests to Yahoo while also caching stock quotes in Redis.</li>

				<li>Started: November 16 (Monday), 2015</li>
				<li>Langage: PHP</li>
				<li>The Philadelphia Indego Bike Share program is interesting to me because of the technology behind it, including the fact that RFID tokens are used to check out bicycles.</li>
				<li>When I realized that <a href="https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/bike-share-stations" target="_blank">an API is available</a> for the bike share stations, I just had to take advantage of it and also created <a href="https://indego.ericoc.com/" target="_blank">https://indego.ericoc.com/</a>.</li>
				<li>I was also asked to write <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/blog/250-tracking-bike-share-usage-in-philadelphia" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">Highcharts.com</a> since I used their graphing library to chart historic bicycle availability per station.

			<ul>
				<li>Started: December 27 (Friday), 2013</li>
				<li>Langage: Bash</li>
				<li>I had a chance to write a quick Bash script meant to forward alerts from the <a href="http://www.zabbix.com/" target="_blank">Zabbix</a> monitoring application to the <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> messaging service as I couldn't find an already existing method by which to do so.</li>
				<li>Since I couldn't find an already existing solution online, I figured I would offer it up to the public even if it is just a short/simple shell script for others to use in case they can't find any thing already online either.</li>

				<li>I originally purchased the domain name "<a href="https://gaw.sh/" target="blank">gaw.sh</a>" as a short address to remember quickly and to have some fun with.</li>
				<li>However, I eventually realized that it would make a great domain name for a URL shortener so I began creating my own.</li>
