BACKGROUND

- I love learning about new technology and furthering my knowledge by maintaining personal Debian servers. I enjoy installing, configuring, and managing various software.
- I have significant experience using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Bash, and am familiar with Python as well as Perl. My personal projects primarily depend upon PHP and MySQL, along with HTML/CSS. However, I don't consider myself a web designer or programmer - I love the command line and systems administration.
- I have an interest in network security and take pride in securing any software and servers that I set up. I have also worked with Cisco Systems routing as well as switching equipment and am very familiar with Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS). I was previously a Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT).
