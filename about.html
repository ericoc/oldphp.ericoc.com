				My name is Eric, but I go by "ericoc" most places online.
				I am a 20-something nerd and am interested in computers and other technical junk.

				I enjoy Linux, systems administration, computer networking, and pretty much any thing involving the command-line including occasional programming.
				My strongest language is probably PHP.
				While I also regularly script in Bash, I do not think of myself as a developer or programmer.
				I enjoy network and systems administration way more than debugging code.

				Unrelated to technology, I really like both playing and watching basketball as well as stand-up comedy and baking.
