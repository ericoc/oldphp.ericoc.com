<h2>Me</h2>
<p>
My name's Eric, but I go by "ericoc" most places online.
I'm a 20-something nerd who's interested in computers and other technical junk.
Over three years ago now (July 2010), I moved to New Jersey from Virginia for an awesome job (Linode).
Since then (September 2012), I moved again to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from New Jersey for another awesome opportunity to advance my career as a Linux Systems Administrator at Urban Outfitters.
I have since left Urban Outfitters to join an awesome startup, SideCar, working as a Software Engineer with many development and operations responsibilities.
Oh, and I have a website, but you probably already knew that.
</p>
<h2>PHP</h2>
<p>
I'm into PHP and I enjoy web design, but honestly, I'm terrible with graphics and design.
I prefer that my websites be as simple as possible (I try to follow the KISS principle [Keep It Short & Simple]).
I really don't get why people flood their websites with heavy images and Flash.
In my opinion, that just distracts from the actual content (and usually wastes bandwidth!).
</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>
Over the past few years, I've been avoiding Microsoft Windows as much as possible.
I really love Debian and Arch Linux, but my MacBook Air is awesome too.
I don't really get why people stick with Windows when they get tons of viruses or it becomes incredibly slow and bogged down.
Maybe I'm crazy, but shouldn't systems be secure by default and not require third party (anti-virus, etc...) software to fix things for them?
</p>
<h2>Networking</h2>
<p>
Over my past few years of using Linux on a daily basis, I've set up a couple of servers.
I've come across quite a few different networking protocols and services that I've learned to configure, work with, and basically just play with.
I've set up httpd (Apache), iptables, nginx, lighttpd, ntpd, mysqld, bind/named, pptpd, openvpn, vsftpd, puppet, sshd, tftpd, and squid among others.
I've never really been able to do much with a mail server though - Google Apps suits my needs perfectly.
I also have a few old Cisco routers and switches that I got cheap off of Craigslist which have both helped me learn quite a bit as well.
