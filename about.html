				My name is Eric, but I go by "ericoc" most places online.
				I'm a 20-something nerd and am interested in computers and other technical junk.
				I love living in Philadelphia and started working at the Comcast headquarters here in early 2016.

				I enjoy Linux, systems administration, computer networking, and pretty much any thing involving the command-line including occasional programming.
				My strongest language is definitely PHP, but I would like to think that my Bash scripting is nice too.
				However, I don't think of myself as a developer or programmer.
				I enjoy network and systems administration way more than debugging code.
				Unrelated to technology, I really like both playing and watching basketball as well as cooking.
